  <p>
    I'm Latrisha, a Cybersecurity Analyst trained through The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship, where I’ve gained hands-on experience in ethical hacking, network defense, and risk assessment. My technical background includes building secure environments using tools like Kali Linux, Snort, pfSense, Wireshark, and AWS—reinforced by completing high-pressure CTF challenges and real-world lab simulations.  
    <br><br>
    With a foundation in system hardening, vulnerability scanning, and compliance frameworks such as NIST and CIS, I'm passionate about helping organizations protect digital infrastructure through rigorous analysis and responsible threat mitigation. I bring a creative mindset, technical discipline, and collaborative spirit to every project—whether reverse-engineering obfuscated code or documenting end-to-end solutions for security readiness.
